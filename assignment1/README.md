# How to run the code

Compile and run the code using the following command:

```bash
make # builds both count-then-move and parallel-buffer

make <target> # builds <target> (e.g. count-then-move)

make clean # removes binary files

make run-count-then-move # runs count-then-move with multiple parameters

make run-parallel-buffer # runs parallel-buffer with multiple parameters

make run-all # runs both count-then-move and parallel-buffer with multiple parameters
```

To see the output write the following:

```bash
./build/<program name>
```
